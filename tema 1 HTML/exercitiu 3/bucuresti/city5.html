                Romania's history has not been as idyllically peaceful as its geography.
                Over the centuries, various migrating people invaded Romania. 
                Romania's historical provinces Wallachia and Moldova offered furious resistance to the invading Ottoman Turks. 
                Transylvania was successively under Habsburg, Ottoman, Hungarian or Wallachian rule,
                while remaining an (semi) autonomous province.

                Romania's post WWII history as a communist-block nation is more widely known, primarily due to the excesses of the former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
                In December 1989 a national uprising led to his overthrow.
                The 1991 Constitution re-established Romania as a republic with a multiparty system, market economy and individual rights of free speech, religion and private ownership.</p>

                Some of the history that has shaped Romania
                What is now Romania has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Age
                as evidenced by carved stone tools unearthed there.

                A distinctive Thracian sub-group emerged in what is now Romania.
                The Greeks called these people Getae, but to the Romans they were Dacians.
                Herodotus called them "the fairest and most courageous of men"
                because they believed in the immortality of the soul and were not afraid to die.
